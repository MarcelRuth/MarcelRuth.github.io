    <h1>Graph Neural Networks</h1>
    <p>
        Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a type of Neural Network that operate directly on graphs.
        They are capable of processing the nodes and edges of a graph, 
        as well as any associated attributes. This makes GNNs particularly
        suited to tasks where the data can naturally be represented as a graph, such as social 
        network analysis, recommendation systems, and molecule design.

        Equation: \( H^{(l+1)} = \sigma( D^{-1} A H^{(l)} W^{(l)} ) \)
    </p>
    <p>
        The equation above describes the propagation rule of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), a popular type of GNN. Here, \( H^{(l)} \) represents the node 
        features at layer \( l \), \( A \) is the adjacency matrix of the graph, \( D \) is the degree matrix of the graph, \( W^{(l)} \) are the trainable 
        weights at layer \( l \), and \( \sigma \) is the activation function.

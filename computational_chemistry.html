    <h1>Computational Chemistry</h1>
    <p>
        Computational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that uses computer simulation to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses methods of theoretical 
        chemistry, incorporated into efficient computer programs, to calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids. It is necessary because, 
        apart from relatively recent results concerning the hydrogen molecular ion, the quantum many-body problem cannot be solved analytically, much less in 
        closed form.

        Equation: \( H\Psi = E\Psi \)
    </p>
    <p>
        The equation above is the Schr√∂dinger equation, the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics. Here, \( H \) is the Hamiltonian operator, \( \Psi \) is 
        the wave function of the system, and \( E \) is the energy eigenvalue.
